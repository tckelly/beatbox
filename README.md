# ü•Å BeatBox

**BeatBox** is a Java-based desktop MIDI sequencer that lets users create and play simple beats using a visual
interface. Built with Java Swing and the javax.sound.midi package, this project demonstrates core concepts in
object-oriented programming, GUI development, and MIDI event handling.

This project was inspired by a tutorial in the Head First Java book.

## Design Patterns Implemented

This project demonstrates the use of several design patterns:

- **Model‚ÄìView‚ÄìController (MVC)**: Separates concerns among data management (`BeatBoxModel`), user interface (`BeatBoxPanel`), and control logic (`BeatBoxController`).
- **Builder Pattern**: Utilized in `BeatBoxModel.Builder` for constructing model instances with customizable configurations.
- **Factory Method Pattern**: Implemented in `BeatBoxAppFactory` to encapsulate the creation logic of application components.
- **Prototype Pattern**: Employed in `BeatBoxController.getModelDefensiveCopy()` to create copies of the model for operations like saving and loading.
- **Command Pattern**: Action classes (`SaveAction`, `OpenAction`, `ExitAction`, etc.) encapsulate operations, promoting modularity and reusability.
- **Observer Pattern**: Used in `CheckBoxGridPanel` via multiple `ActionListener` implementations. The application's architecture supports future integration of observer mechanisms for completely responsive UI updates.
- **Data Transfer Object (DTO)**: The PlaybackData interface is used to expose only the playback state to the MIDI layer, keeping the model encapsulated.

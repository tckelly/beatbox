# ü•Å BeatBox

**BeatBox** is a Java-based desktop MIDI sequencer that lets users create and play simple beats using a visual
interface. Built with Java Swing and the javax.sound.midi package, this project demonstrates core concepts in
object-oriented programming, GUI development, and MIDI event handling.

This project was inspired by a tutorial in the Head First Java book.
